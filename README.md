# Customer-Segmentation using Classification Methods
Abstract:

Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses to target their most valuable customers effectively. This project analyzes a dataset from a retail chain to understand the factors influencing customer segmentation. Despite achieving an accuracy of 47.5% with a neural network model, there's room for improvement.

Source:

The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, comprises 8068 observations with 11 features, including age, gender, profession, and spending score.

Introduction:

In today's competitive landscape, data-driven strategies like customer segmentation help businesses tailor marketing efforts and enhance revenue. This report aims to identify key segmentation factors using customer data.

Method:

The project employs various classification methods for customer segmentation analysis, including data preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation.

Data Set:

The dataset consists of customer information, including ID, gender, marital status, age, education, profession, work experience, spending score, family size, an anonymized variable, and segmentation.

Data Pre-processing:

Outliers and missing values are handled by filtering and replacing techniques. Visualization aids in understanding variable distributions and relationships.

Prediction:

Histograms and correlation analysis help understand the numeric variables' impact on segmentation. Categorical features' relationship with segmentation is visualized using stacked bar plots and density plots.

Model Building:

Machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Multinomial Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine, are employed for segmentation prediction.

Evaluation:

Model performance is assessed using accuracy metrics, with neural network achieving 47.5% accuracy on the test set.

Conclusion:

The report provides insights into customer segmentation, suggesting avenues for future improvement and applications in targeted marketing and revenue enhancement.
